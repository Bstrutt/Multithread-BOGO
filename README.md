A useless sorting algorithm that is multithreaded. One thread will shuffle the collection, the second thread will check it for order, there
will be a queue in between that lines the collections up for verification. Will be done in c/c++. The purpose is to learn more about 
multithreading, not to make a valuable sorting algorithm.
